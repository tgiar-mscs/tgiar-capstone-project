## **WORK EMERGENCIES WEBSITE**

### **DESCRIPTION**
This is a very simple and quick website that people can use for fast results on what to do in a work emergency. Just one click, a couple letters to type and it will pull up the emergency at hand and give numbered steps on what to do. Each emergency will have it's own page. 

### **LANGUAGES USED**
* I will be using SQL server to create a database. 
* I will be using HTML and CSS to build and style the website.
* I will be using JavaScript for my events. 

### **TOOLS USED**
I will be using VS Code, bootstrap, Microsoft SQL Server, and possibly Microsoft Visual Studio for this project.
